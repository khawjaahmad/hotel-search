## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Flutter Doctor Issues
```bash
# Android SDK not found
flutter config --android-sdk /path/to/android/sdk

# iOS deployment issues (macOS)
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

#### 2. Patrol Installation Issues
```bash
# Reset Patrol
dart pub global deactivate patrol_cli
dart pub global activate patrol_cli

# Clean Patrol cache
patrol clean
```

#### 3. Build Issues
```bash
# Clean Flutter
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Regenerate code
flutter pub run build_runner clean
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

#### 4. Device Connection Issues
```bash
# Android
adb kill-server
adb start-server
adb devices

# iOS Simulator
xcrun simctl shutdown all
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 16 Plus"
```

### Performance Optimization

#### 1. Build Performance
```bash
# Enable parallel builds
export FLUTTER_BUILD_PARALLEL=true

# Use more memory for Gradle
export GRADLE_OPTS="-Xmx4g -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=2g"
```

#### 2. Test Performance
```bash
# Run tests in parallel
patrol test --parallel

# Skip slow tests during development
flutter test --exclude-tags slow
```
